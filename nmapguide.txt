The state is either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered.

 Open.  means that an application on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port.

 Filtered.  means that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is open or closed.


  Closed. ports have no application listening on them, though they could open up at any time. though they could open up at any time.

 Ports are classified as unfiltered.  when they are responsive to Nmap´s probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or closed. Nmap reports the state combinations open|filtered. and closed|filtered. 


 Nmap can provide further information on targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.
